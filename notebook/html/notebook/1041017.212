The new features in this version of E-Note can be configured via the  
configuration file (enote.pl).  It is advised that the supplied  
enote112.pl file be adapted to your needs, but existing enote.pl   
files will work with little or no modification (but some new  
features will be disabled).  
  
Main new features:  
  
* Printing  
  
  Use the Print buttons to print either all the pages in the notebook,  
  all the pages matching a search, or individual pages.  
  The print button for individual pages is off by default but can be  
  enabled in the configuration via the line:  
  $main::printpage = 1;  
  Note that page-breaks after each enote 'page' will not work in  
  older browsers (such as Netscape versions before 6).  
  You will also need the line:  
  $main::print_wd = 38;  
  - which is in the provided enote112.pl file.  
  
  
* Subscription  
  
  E-Note can notify users via email of modifications to pages in  
  notebooks to which they subscribe.  Subscription is turned on  
  in the configuration via the line:  
  $main::subscribe = 1;  
  
  You will also need the lines:  
  $main::subscribe_wd = 68;  
  $main::unsubscribe_wd = 84;  
  - which are in the provided enote112.pl file.  
  
  Users subscribe via a name and email address.  Any changes to the  
  pages of notebooks listed in an enote.pl file will cause an email  
  notification to be sent detailing the changed pages.  The update  
  process is run by executing the enote.pl program directly  
  (as opposed to the web-server executing it as a cgi executable).  
  Under UNIX this can be achieved simply by:  
  >enote112.pl  
  (or if the enote112.pl is not marked as executable, >perl enote112.pl)  
  
  This command can be scheduled to run automatically once a day  
  or once a week by using the Unix "at" command or the  
  Windows task scheduler.  
  
  Before subscriptions/unsubscriptions can be made, a subscription  
  'database' file must be created.  Just create an empty file  
  that is writable by the web-server (typically in the same directory  
  as the notebook directory).  This file must then be referenced in   
  the configuration file. For example:  
  $main::subscription = '/var/www/html/subscriptions.ens';  
  
  By default, the list of subscribers to a notebook on the subscription   
  page shows both the names and emails.  If your notebook is accessible  
  via the web externally, you may wish to disable the display of  
  email addresses so that they cannot be collected by SPAM-bots.  
  Use the line:  
  $main::showemails = 0;  
  to disable or  
  $main::showemails = 1;  
  to enable the display of email addresses.  
  
  It is also a good idea to set a reply address for email notifications:  
  $main::subscriptionReplyTo = 'E-Note <NoReturnAddress@nowhere.com>';  
    
  In addition, there are two mechanisms for email to be sent from  
  the enote program - SMTP and the UNIX sendmail command.  
  To use SMTP directly, you must add the lines:  
  $main::useSendmailCommand = 0;  
  $main::SMTPHost = 'smtp.host.com';  
  (substituting the hostname of an SMTP mail server)  
  To use UNIX sendmail, add the lines:  
  $main::useSendmailCommand = 1;  
  $main::sendmail = '/usr/sbin/sendmail';  
  
  To use the SMTP method, you will also need the new Sendmail.pm file  
  in the same directory as enotelib.pl.
